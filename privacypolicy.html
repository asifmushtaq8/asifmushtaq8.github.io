  </header>

  <section>
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Your Privacy Matters</h2>
    <p>
      This Phantom Studio privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) is applicable to the 
data that is obtained from you when you use our mobile applications 
named Phantom Studio (the “Apps”) (collectively, “Phantom Studio”).

Our Privacy Policy describes what personal and non-personal information we 
collect from you, how we obtain it, how we secure it, how we share it, 
how you can access and modify it, and how you can restrict how we share 
it. The Privacy Policy also explains some of your legal rights regarding
 your personal data. </p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Important Terms </h2>
<p>
- ‘NON-PERSONAL DATA’ is information that is in no way personally identifiable.

-
 ‘PERSONAL DATA’ means any information relating to an identified or 
identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural 
person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly by reference 
to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location 
data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the 
physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social 
identity of that natural person. PD is in many ways the same as 
Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, PD is broader in 
scope and covers more data.

- ‘GDPR’ is the EU General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679).

- ‘COPPA’ is the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule.

- ‘CCPA’ is the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> What information is collected and how we intend to use it </h2>
<p>
When you use Phantom Studio, we may collect personal data from you. For the sake 
of public accountability, we describe in detail what personal 
information we collect and have access to, why we use them, and the 
legal bases on which we treat your personal data.

When you use the Phantom Studio we use such data for the following purposes:

- To approve your age;
- To save your game progress;
- To maintain your user account;
- Allow you to play the game from multiple devices;
- To send promotional emails (if you consent to them); and
- To reply to support emails.

We rely on three legal bases: "performance of a contract with you," "your 
consent" (for promotional emails), and "pursuit of our legitimate 
business interests" (i.e., to ensure security, analyze and grow Phantom Studio).
</p>

 <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Analytical data </h2>
<p>
When you download Phantom Studio from the Google Play Store, we use Firebase 
(https://firebase.google.com), a third-party analytics service provided 
by Google LLC, which gathers the following technical personal and 
non-personal data from you:
<ul>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>Number of sessions</li>
<li>Session duration </li>
<li>Retention</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Install source and</li>
<li>IDFA</li>
  
</ul>
  </p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> We use such data to: </h2>
    <p>
- Analyse the technical aspects of your use of our games <br>
- Optimise our applications for your needs<br>
- Prevention of fraud and abuse<br>
- Ensure the safety and<br>
- Treat you to relevant ads.<br>
  
The legal basis that we rely on when processing the above-mentioned data is
 “pursuing our legitimate business interests” (i.e., to analyse, grow, 
and protect Phantom Studio).
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Contacting us </h2>
    <p>
We have access to your name, (ii) your email account, and (iii) any other 
data you choose to include in your message when you send us an email. We
 use your personal information to respond to your queries and deliver 
the information you've requested. The legal bases on which we treat such
 personal data are "pursuing our legitimate business interests" (i.e., 
to grow and promote Phantom Studio) and "your consent" (for optional personal
 data that you decide, at your sole discretion, to provide us).

For marketing purposes, we do not sell or rent your personal information to
 third parties. We may share your personal information with third-party 
service providers who work on our behalf (our data processors). These 
third-party service providers include:

Our analytics service provider Google Firebase (https://firebase.google.com) located in the United States;
  </p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Legally Required Releases of Information </h2>

We may be legally required to disclose your personal data if such disclosure is

(a) required by subpoena, law, or other legal process;

</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Retention and Destruction of Your Personal Data </h2>
We only preserve information about you (including your personal data) for 
as long as we need it for the reasons for which it was collected or for 
other legal, business, or tax considerations (if we have a legal basis

information when we no longer require it.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Protection of Privacy Rights of Third Parties </h2>
  <p>
If you share information about third parties on Phantom Studio, you promise to 
make certain that you have their permission. While we cannot be held 
liable for our users' behavior, we will remove any postings about which
 we are told if they infringe on others' privacy rights.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Links of Other Websites </h2>
  <p>
Phantom Studio contains links to other websites. These websites are not under 
our control, and our Privacy Statement does not apply to them. These 
sites will almost certainly have their own privacy policies. These 
websites are not under our control, and we simply provide links to them 
for your convenience. You acknowledge and accept that your use of and 
access to these websites is at your sole risk. It is your duty to read 
these websites' privacy policies to see how they handle your personal 
information.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Do Not Track Settings </h2>
  <p>

movements. Such parameters are ignored when communicated to and 
identified by Phantom Studio. By checking the user manual for your browser, 
you can disable tracking features and other security options.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Commercial Communications and Emails </h2>
<p>

when you signed up for Phantom Studio. Your email address will be used to 
send you crucial Phantom Studio-related information and technical notices. If

promotional material about Phantom Studio or offers from us or our 
affiliates.

You can opt-out from receiving commercial communication at any time by

</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Protection of Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
I Phantom Studio features Apps and Games that are designed for children. We have 
gathered as little personal data on children as possible. We do not 
collect personal data from children under the age of consent or who are 
unable to provide valid consent in accordance with the COPPA or GDPR. We recognize that a child who is not of legal age to agree may attempt to 
access Phantom Studio and provide consent where necessary (e.g., for our use 
of non-essential cookies). As a result, all App users are required to 
provide their age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from 
children under the age of consent (e.g., 13 in the United States, 16 in 
the European Union). Simply notify us if you are a parent or guardian 
and believe your child is using Phantom Studio without your permission. 
Before removing any information, we may ask for proof of identity to 
prevent harmful removal. If we detect a youngster using Phantom Studio 
without permission from their parents, we will erase their information 
as soon as possible.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Security Policy </h2>
  <p>
We created Phantom Studio with industry-standard security features and 
authentication tools to guarantee the protection of your personal data. 
Technical and physical precautions are in place to protect your personal
 data, both by us and by third-party service providers. Our security 
precautions include secured networks, SSL protocol, strong passwords, 
limited access to your personal data by our staff, and anonymization of 
personal data (when possible).

We cannot guarantee the security of data transmission or the avoidance of 
loss or misuse of your personal data due to the nature of the Internet. 
We strongly advise you not to share your Phantom Studio passwords with 
anybody.
  </p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Transferring of Personal Data from the EEA </h2>
    <p>
The personal data we gather from you may be stored, processed, and 
transferred to any country in which we or our data processors operate. 
The European Union has found that the United States and a few other 
nations do not guarantee an appropriate degree of personal data 
protection, according to Article 45 of the GDPR.
Derogations,
 as specified in GDPR Article 49, are used in specific instances. If 
such a transfer is necessary, we will make certain that the country in 
where the recipient third party is located offers an acceptable level of
 protection for your personal data, or we will enter into an agreement 
with the respective third party that does (e.g., a data processing 
agreement based on pre-approved standard contractual clauses).
  </p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;"> Amendments to the Privacy Policy </h2>
    <p>
At any moment, we retain the right to amend our Privacy Policy. We'll 
provide updates to the Website and Apps so you're always up to date on 
what personal data we gather, use, and disclose. If we have your email 
address on file, we will notify you of any changes we make.
